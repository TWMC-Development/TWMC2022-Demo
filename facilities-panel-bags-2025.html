            <h4>Policy Overview</h4>
          <p>In an effort to enhance the safety and protection of our members and guests, we have established a strict policy prohibiting backpacks and similar-sized bags in worship services. Any bag in question will be subject to immediate search by a member of the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) or our security team. This policy is intended to keep our congregation and visitors safe and free from distractions during our worship services.</p>
        
          <h4>When</h4>
          <p>During all worship and special services (i.e. Sunday Morning, Funerals/Memorials, Mid-week Prayer). This policy applies only to worship and special services. Conferences or other events may have their own security protocols.</p>

          </ul>
