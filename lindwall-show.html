        <p class="twmc-p">Rev. David Lindwall is no stranger to The Woodlands Methodist Church. David and his family lived in The Woodlands in the ’90s when David worked for Shell, and they were members of TWMC. David even taught the Cornerstone Sunday school class. </p>
        <p class="twmc-p">Growing up in Georgia, David felt a call to ministry, but he didn’t pursue it. Even during his time at the University of Georgia, followed by a 15-year career with Shell, he continued to feel God’s tug on his heart for ministry. </p>
        <p class="twmc-p">While at TWMC the first time, David shared his calling with some close friends and founding pastor Dr. Ed Robb, a calling which they affirmed. However, following the birth of their twins, who nearly died at birth, David and his wife, Stephanie, felt it wasn’t the time to enroll in seminary, and David took a posting to London with Shell. </p>
        <p class="twmc-p">In London, the call on David’s life became something he couldn’t ignore. Stephanie began to feel called as well. So, they packed up their family of six and moved to Kentucky, where David graduated from Asbury Theological Seminary in 2002. </p>
        <p class="twmc-p">After seminary, David served East Texas Methodist churches in Wells and Longview, and in 2010 he was appointed to the Methodist church in Montgomery. He now serves as Pastor of Caring and Adult Outreach at The Woodlands Methodist Church. </p>
        <p class="twmc-p hidden"> </p>
        <p class="twmc-p hidden">  </p>
        <p class="twmc-p">David and Stephanie live in Montgomery. Their children — Jack (wife Morgan, granddaughter Ruthie), Grace, Hannah (husband Casey), and McKinley (husband Will, granddaughter Ruth Ann) — live in the Houston area. </p>
