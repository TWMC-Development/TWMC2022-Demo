                              <p>God is the Creator and Ruler of the universe. He exists
                                  eternally in three persons: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. God is
                                  both holy and loving.</p>

                              <p class="twmc-mbzero twmc-mts"><strong>About Jesus
                                  Christ</strong></p>
                              <p>Jesus Christ is the unique Son of God. He lived a sinless
                                  human life and died on the cross to atone for our sins. He rose from the
                                  dead and ascended to heaven and will return again to Earth.</p>

                              <p class="twmc-mbzero twmc-mts"><strong>About the Holy
                                  Spirit</strong></p>
                              <p>The Holy Spirit is present in the world to make people aware
                                  of their need for Jesus Christ. When we receive Jesus as the leader of our
                                  lives and the forgiver of our sins, the Holy Spirit comes to live within us.
                                  He provides us with power for living, enables us to understand spiritual
                                  truth and guides us in doing what pleases God. As Christians we seek to
                                  live under His control daily.</p>

                              <p class="twmc-mbzero twmc-mts"><strong>About the Bible</strong>
                              </p>
                              <p>The Bible is God’s word written by human authors under the
                                  supernatural guidance of the Holy Spirit. It is the final authority for
                                  determining our Christian beliefs and how we are to live.</p>

                              <p class="twmc-mbzero twmc-mts"><strong>About Human
                                  Beings</strong></p>
                              <p>People are made in the spiritual image of God — we are
                                  rational and moral beings. Because we are God’s creation made in God’s
                                  image, each person possesses great self-worth. Although every person has
                                  tremendous potential for good, all of us are marred by an attitude of
                                  self-centeredness which the Bible calls “sin.” This attitude and its
                                  resultant actions separate us from God, others and ourselves.</p>

                              <p class="twmc-mbzero twmc-mts"><strong>About being made right
                                  with God</strong></p>
                              <p>Becoming right with God and having our relationship with God
                                  restored is what the Bible calls salvation. Salvation is God’s free gift to
                                  us. We can never earn it or achieve it by self-improvement or good works. We
                                  accept God’s gift of a new life when we turn from our self-ruled life and
                                  accept Jesus as our Savior. The new life that God gives us is an abundant
                                  life in this world and eternal life in the world to come.</p>

                              <p class="twmc-mbzero twmc-mts"><strong>About the kind of life we are called to</strong></p>
                              <p class="twmc-mbs">Though we are not made right with God by our own
                                  goodness, “good works” are not optional for the Christian life. When we give
                                  our lives to Christ, it is expected that we will grow toward loving God
                                  with all our being and our neighbors as ourselves.</p>

                                church and our identification as children of God. God initiates this
                                relationship and chooses us as daughters and sons, beginning our lifelong
                                journey of faith. God’s choice happens regardless of our age or our
                                response. Because God chooses us once and for all, this is an act that
                                should not be repeated. Those that are baptized as children must make the
                                choice to confirm their belief in Christ to continue as members of the
                                church. If you were baptized as a child, there is no need to be baptized
                                again. If your child was baptized as a baby, he/she can later make the
                                choice to profess his/her own faith in Christ in our Confirmation program
                                for 6th graders. Baptism for children and adults is offered several times
                                per year. There is a mandatory training for families prior to each date.</p>

                                and New Testament of whose authority was never any doubt in the church. The

                                fall into sin, and, by the grace of God, rise again and amend our lives. And
                                therefore they are to be condemned who say they can no more sin as long as
                                they live here; or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly
                                repent.</p>

                                SACRAMENTS:</strong></p>
                            <p> Sacraments ordained of Christ are not only badges or tokens
                                of Christian men’s profession, but rather they are certain signs of grace,
                                and God’s good will toward us, by which he doth work invisibly in us, and
                                doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and confirm, our faith in him.
                                There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel; that is
                                to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord. Those five commonly called
                                sacraments, that is to say, confirmation, penance, orders, matrimony, and
                                extreme unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel; being
                                such as have partly grown out of the corrupt following of the apostles, and
                                partly are states of life allowed in the Scriptures, but yet have not the
                                like nature of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, because they have not any
                                visible sign or ceremony ordained of God. The Sacraments were not ordained
                                of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be carried about; but that we should duly
                                use them. And in such only as worthily receive the same, they have a
                                wholesome effect or operation; but they that receive them unworthily,
                                purchase to themselves condemnation, as St. Paul saith.</p>

                                BAPTISM:</strong></p>
                            <p> Baptism is not only a sign of profession and mark of
                                difference whereby Christians are distinguished from others that are not
                                baptized; but it is also a sign of regeneration or the new birth. The
                                Baptism of young children is to be retained in the Church.</p>


                            <p class="twmc-mbzero twmc-mts"><strong>ARTICLE XVIII—OF THE
                                LORD’S SUPPER:</strong></p>
                            <p> The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that
                                Christians ought to have among themselves one to another, but rather is a
                                sacrament of our redemption by Christ’s death; insomuch that, to such as
                                rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the bread which we break
                                is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise the cup of blessing is a
                                partaking of the blood of Christ. Transubstantiation, or the change of the
                                substance of bread and wine in the Supper of our Lord, cannot be proved by
                                Holy Writ, but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth
                                the nature of a sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions.
                                The body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper, only after a
                                heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the body of Christ is
                                received and eaten in the Supper is faith. The Sacrament of the Lord’s
                                Supper was not by Christ’s ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or
                                worshiped.</p>

                            <p class="twmc-mbzero twmc-mts"><strong>ARTICLE XIX—OF BOTH

                            <p> The cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the lay people;
                                for both the parts of the Lord’s Supper, by Christ’s ordinance and
                                commandment, ought to be administered to all Christians alike.</p>

                            <p> The offering of Christ, once made, is that perfect
                                redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction for all the sins of the whole
                                world, both original and actual; and there is none other satisfaction for
                                sin but that alone. Wherefore the sacrifice of masses, in the which it is
                                commonly said that the priest doth offer Christ for the quick and the dead,
                                to have remission of pain or guilt, is a blasphemous fable and dangerous
                                deceit.</p>

                            <p> The ministers of Christ are not commanded by God’s law either
                                to vow the estate of single life, or to abstain from marriage; therefore it
                                is lawful for them, as for all other Christians, to marry at their own
                                discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve best to godliness.</p>

                            <p> It is not necessary that rites and ceremonies should in all
                                places be the same, or exactly alike; for they have been always different,
                                and may be changed according to the diversity of countries, times, and men’s
                                manners, so that nothing be ordained against God’s Word. Whosoever, through
                                his private judgment, willingly and purposely doth openly break the rites
                                and ceremonies of the church to which he belongs, which are not repugnant to
                                the Word of God, and are ordained and approved by common authority, ought to
                                be rebuked openly, that others may fear to do the like, as one that
                                offendeth against the common order of the church, and woundeth the
                                consciences of weak brethren. Every particular church may ordain, change, or
                                abolish rites and ceremonies, so that all things may be done to
