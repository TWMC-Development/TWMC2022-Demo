                                        in faithful obedience to you by
                                        following Christ's example

                                        that reflects the beauty,

                                        We are reminded of the branches
                                        and the disciples that threw their leaves down
                                        as Jesus rode over those leaves.
                                        It was a reminder that they were laying
                                        their lives down before him.
                                        But this is a week, God,
                                        That we're reminded that Jesus
                                        would actually lay his life down for us.
                                        And there's great power in that.
                                        There's power in being a people
                                        who spread the good news.
                                        So on this holy week, may we walk it slowly.
                                        May we savor every step
                                        and be reminded that light overcomes darkness.
                                        That Jesus has come
                                        and there is good news
                                        in this resurrection story.
                                        Amen. </p>
