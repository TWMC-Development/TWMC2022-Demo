      <p class="twmc-p twmc-mbxs">
       <strong>Confirmation</strong> is a sacred rite of passage in which baptized believers
        publicly affirm their faith in Jesus Christ and commit to following Him
        as faithful disciples. All incoming 6th graders—whether already baptized
        or not—are welcome to participate. Those who have not yet been baptized
        will have the opportunity to receive baptism prior to the Confirmation
        ceremony. Through a <strong>year-long journey of discipleship</strong> rooted in
        Scripture and supported by Christian community, confirmands are
        spiritually formed to become <strong>full members</strong> of The Woodlands Methodist
        Church—empowered by the Holy Spirit and sent to live on mission for the
        Kingdom of God.
